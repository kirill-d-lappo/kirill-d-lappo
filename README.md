.Net Developer with 1+ year experience in full-stack development

## Work Experience

* `.Net Developer` at Oxagile

    *May 2019 â€“ Present*

    **Responsibilities**:

    * Stories and task assessment, work planning
    * Stories implementations
    * Code investigation
    * Code clean up and refactoring
    * Code review
    * Issue verifications and investigations
    * [Minor] Helped with CI processes support

    **Achievements**:

    * Set up monitoring tool(`Grafana`) for QA environments, where it collects logs and checks server state. 

      That helped our team a lot with issue detection in multiple environments.
 
    * Created build scripts, that create a customized install solution (Install Shield, custom launchers, etc.). 

      It significantly reduced the amount of manual work and build time (11-14 minutes of a pure script running).

* `Automation Engineer` at Oxagile

    *December 2016 â€“ May 2019*

    **Responsibilities:**
    * Writing test cases
    * Implementing test cases
    * `Test Framework` support and development, integration with outer services: `TFS` (old version of `Azure DevOps`), `Report Portal`
    * `Automation Testing` process support: build, deploy, execution

    **Achievements**:

    * Tests executions were moved to `Docker` containers, which made our team virtually independent from technical or/and infrastructure changes on a project.

      We were able to move text execution into `AWS` cloud infrastructure.

    * Fixed bug in `nunit3-vs-test` project, which did not allow test projects to create attachments during test execution on Linux environment. [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/494)
