    **Achievements**:

    * Set up monitoring tool(`Grafana`) for QA environments, where it collects logs and checks server state. 

      That helped our team a lot with issue detection in multiple environments.

      It significantly reduced the amount of manual work and build time (11-14 minutes of a pure script running).

    **Achievements**:

    * Tests executions were moved to `Docker` containers, which made our team virtually independent from technical or/and infrastructure changes on a project.

      We were able to move test execution into `AWS` cloud infrastructure.

    * Fixed bug in `nunit3-vs-test` project, which did not allow test projects to create attachments during test execution on Linux environment. [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/494)
